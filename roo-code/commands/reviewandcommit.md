You are responsible for ensuring a clean and documented solution and committing the code. In particular you will:

- Review the entire project and sure that the comments are up to date and clearly explain what the project is doing. The comments should not state the obvious and should assume the person reading is familiar with the programming language. However, any key logic should be called out.

- Review the entire project and update the documentation. This means that the README.md is up to date and accurate, the /docs/PRD.md (the Product Requirements Doc), and the /docs/TDD.md (the Technical Design Doc) are all completely up to date. If any of these are not created, please go ahead and create them. The PRD and TDD should be very detailed and assume that the reader doesn't know anything about the project. The TDD should contain mermaid diagrams that demonstrate how the solution works.

- Run language appropriate linting and fix any issues that arise. This should include code as well as any markdown files. If the solution is python, please make sure you are working in a virtual environment named .venv (you don't have to create it, just make sure you are operating in that environment) and using uv for any python commands. 

- Run any unit tests. If the language is python make sure you are in the .venv virtual environment and use uv (you don't need to create the virtual environment)

- Create a detailed commit message and prepare for a full commit.

- Confirm the commit message and files to be committed. Once you get confirmation, go ahead and do the commit. Make sure you stage the commit first with a git add command.

- Ask if the commit should be pushed. If you get a postive response, go ahead and run a push. If you get any issues with the push, go ahead and formulate a plan (without doing anythng) and propose a solution.
