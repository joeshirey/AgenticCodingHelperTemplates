# Agentic Coding Helper Templates

This repository provides a collection of helper templates and configurations to enhance your agentic coding workflow, with a focus on developing with the Google GenAI SDK and the Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to provide pre-configured environments and personas for AI-powered coding assistants, ensuring they have the right context and instructions to be effective partners in your development process. This repository contains configurations for the following tools:

-   **[Google Gemini CLI](gemini-cli/README.md):** A command-line interface for interacting with Google's Gemini models.
-   **[Roo Code](roo-code/README.md):** A VS Code extension that provides an AI-powered coding assistant.

## Directories

### `gemini-cli`

This directory contains a configuration for the [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli) that establishes a persona for an expert in the Google GenAI SDK and the Agent Development Kit (ADK). This allows you to have a specialized AI assistant directly in your terminal.

For more information, see the [`gemini-cli/README.md`](gemini-cli/README.md).

### `roo-code`

This directory contains a custom mode for the [Roo Code](https://www.moor.so/) VS Code extension, tailored for developers working with the Google GenAI SDK and the ADK. This mode configures the Roo Code assistant to be an expert in Google's generative AI technologies, with a strong emphasis on modern Python development practices using `uv`.

For more information, see the [`roo-code/README.md`](roo-code/README.md).

## Getting Started

1.  **Choose your tool:** Decide whether you want to use the Gemini CLI, Roo Code, or both.
2.  **Follow the setup instructions:** Navigate to the appropriate directory (`gemini-cli` or `roo-code`) and follow the installation and configuration instructions in the respective `README.md` files.
3.  **Start coding:** Once configured, you can start interacting with your specialized AI assistant, which will have the context and expertise to help you with your Google GenAI and ADK development tasks.
